      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19) is an infectious disease caused by
      severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 . It was first identified
      in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing
      pandemic. As of 14 August 2020, more than 21 million cases have been
      reported across 188 countries and territories, resulting in more than
      761,000 deaths. More than 13 million people have recovered. Common
      symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of
      smell and taste. While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop
      acute respiratory distress syndrome possibly precipitated by cytokine
      storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The time from
      exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days, but may range
      from two to fourteen days.
